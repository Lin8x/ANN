## About A.N.N

**[Welcome to the Game II](https://store.steampowered.com/app/720250/Welcome_to_the_Game_II/)** is an atmospheric horror / strategy / puzzle game that takes you into the world of the deep web, in search of the shadow web. 

The game puts you to the task of saving a girl, Amalea, and how to get there. You are tasked to seek out 8 hidden hashes to decrypt the shadow web browser. You do this by using a simulated computer operating system on a computer. This simulated operating system will come with tools to help you on your way. One of these tools is a shadow web browser tool called "[A.N.N](https://welcometothegame.fandom.com/wiki/A.N.N)", based on the real life browser, [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/).
